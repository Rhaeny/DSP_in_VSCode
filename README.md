# About DSP
A dynamic server page (DSP) is a document embedded with special codes (tags) that instruct IBM webMethods Integration Server to perform certain actions when an HTTP (or HTTPS) client requests the document. DSPs are used to construct browser-based applications. Because they are HTML based, they can be used to build complex user interfaces that includes any valid construct (e.g., forms, cascading style sheets, JavaScript) recognized by the clientâ€™s browser.

## Features
